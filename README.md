# tts-nigeria
a Nigerian accented tts model


## Base Model
The base model will be based on either Tortoise-tts or T5 from google


### Dataset
Thank God for @benjaminogbonna. He provided a free audio dataset of accented nigerian speech.

The Nigerian Accent Speech Data is a comprehensive dataset of about 8 hours of audio recordings featuring speakers from various regions of Nigeria, capturing the rich diversity of Nigerian accents. This dataset is specifically curated to address the gap in speech and language datasets for African accents, making it a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech-to-text (STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), Accent recognition, and Natural language processing (NLP) systems.


### Hardware
The model was trained on an a100 sxm instance on runpod.
